# Response Capability

## Overview

The response capability in the AURA project is designed to enhance the effectiveness of security incident management by providing a comprehensive framework for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security threats. This capability integrates various tools and methodologies to ensure a unified approach across different security platforms, enabling teams to respond swiftly and effectively to incidents.

## Linkage

Response capabilities are linked to other AURA Response components, such as:

- **Phases**: Each response capability is associated with specific phases of incident management, ensuring a structured approach to handling security incidents.
- **Playbooks**: Response capabilities are integrated into playbooks, providing detailed guidance on how to implement specific response actions based on the context of the incident.
- **Tools**: The framework incorporates various security tools and platforms, allowing for a seamless response to incidents across different environments.
- **Frameworks**: Response capabilities are aligned with established security frameworks and standards, ensuring compliance and best practices in incident management.
- **Stakeholders/Actors**: The framework identifies key stakeholders involved in the incident response process, ensuring a coordinated effort in managing security incidents.

## Schema

The response capability schema outlines the structure and components of the AURA Response framework, including:

- **Capability ID**: A unique identifier for each response capability, following the format `C0001`, `C0002`, etc.
- **Friendly Name**: A human-readable name for the capability, such as "Incident Detection" or "Threat Analysis".
- **Description**: A detailed description of the capability, outlining its purpose and how it integrates with other components in the AURA Response framework.
- **Linked Components**: A list of components that are linked to the capability, such as phases, playbooks, tools, and frameworks.

### Stakeholder

A stakeholder is an individual or group involved in the incident response process. Each stakeholder has specific roles and responsibilities, ensuring a coordinated effort in managing security incidents.  In the AURA Response framework, stakeholders are categorized based on their involvement in the incident response process, such as:
- Incident Response Team (IRT): The primary team responsible for managing and responding to security incidents.
- Security Operations Center (SOC): The team that monitors and analyzes security events, providing real-time insights into potential threats.
- IT Support: The team that assists in the technical aspects of incident response, such as system recovery and data restoration.

### Actor

An actor is a specific role within the incident response process, responsible for executing tasks and actions related to security incidents. Actors are defined based on their expertise and responsibilities, ensuring that the right individuals are assigned to the appropriate tasks. In the AURA Response framework, actors are categorized based on their roles, such as:
- Incident Handler: The individual responsible for managing the incident response process, coordinating efforts among stakeholders.
- Forensic Analyst: The expert responsible for analyzing digital evidence and identifying the root cause of security incidents.
- Threat Intelligence Analyst: The individual responsible for gathering and analyzing threat intelligence to inform incident response actions.

## Schema Fields
