## Capabilities

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Access External HTTP Logs](C1104.md) | [C1104](../../capability/preparation/C1104.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing external HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access External DNS Logs](C1106.md) | [C1106](../../capability/preparation/C1106.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access external DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. External DNS logs differ from internal DNS logs as they capture communication from internal systems to external domains, providing insights into outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration attempts. |
| [Block External IP Address](C3101.md) | [C3101](../../capability/containment/C3101.md) | Containment | This capability involves blocking external IP addresses that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic from these IP addresses is denied. |
| [Block Port External Communication](C3107.md) | [C3107](../../capability/containment/C3107.md) | Containment | This capability involves blocking external communication on specific ports that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic on these ports is denied. |
| [Block External Domain](C3103.md) | [C3103](../../capability/containment/C3103.md) | Containment | This capability involves blocking external domains that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through DNS filtering, firewall rules, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic to these domains is denied. |
| [Block External URL](C3105.md) | [C3105](../../capability/containment/C3105.md) | Containment | This capability involves blocking external URLs that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through web filtering, firewall rules, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic to these URLs is denied. |
| [List Hosts Communicating with External Domain](C2113.md) | [C2113](../../capability/identification/C2113.md) | Identification | This capability involves identifying and listing hosts that are communicating with a specific external domain. It is essential for understanding network traffic patterns, detecting potential security threats, and ensuring that only authorized hosts are interacting with external resources. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, logs analysis, or other methods to track communication flows within the network. |
| [Unblock Blocked Domain](C5102.md) | [C5102](../../capability/recovery/C5102.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking a domain that has been previously blocked due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the domain is no longer a threat, and updating DNS or security rules accordingly. |
| [Unblock Blocked URL](C5103.md) | [C5103](../../capability/recovery/C5103.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking a URL that has been previously blocked due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the URL is no longer a threat, and updating web filtering or security rules accordingly. |
| [Unblock Blocked Port](C5104.md) | [C5104](../../capability/recovery/C5104.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking a port that has been previously blocked due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the port is no longer a threat, and updating firewall or security rules accordingly. |
| [Unblock Blocked IP](C5101.md) | [C5101](../../capability/recovery/C5101.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking an IP address that has been previously blocked due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the IP is no longer a threat, and updating firewall or security rules accordingly. |
