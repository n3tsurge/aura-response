| [Establish Ability to Block User External Communication](C1119.md) | [C1119](../../capability/preparation/C1119.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block user external communication that is deemed malicious or poses a threat to the organization's network. This includes configuring firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other security appliances to effectively block traffic from users to external entities. It is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks from external sources. |
| [Establish Ability to Block User Internal Communication](C1120.md) | [C1120](../../capability/preparation/C1120.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block user internal communication that is deemed malicious or poses a threat to the organization's network. This includes configuring firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other security appliances to effectively block traffic from users to internal entities. It is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks from within the organization. |
| [Establish Ability to Block Processes by Metadata](C1408.md) | [C1408](../../capability/preparation/C1408.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block processes by their metadata. This includes implementing mechanisms to prevent specific processes from executing based on various metadata attributes such as process name, user, command line arguments, and other relevant information. It is essential for enhancing security by preventing unauthorized or malicious processes from running, thereby protecting the system from potential threats. |
