## Capabilities

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Establish a Communication Map](C1007.md) | [C1007](../../capability/preparation/C1007.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing a communication map that outlines how information will be shared during an incident. It includes identifying key stakeholders, defining communication channels, and ensuring that all parties understand their roles in the communication process. This is essential for effective coordination and response during security incidents. |
| [Access External Flow Logs](C1101.md) | [C1101](../../capability/preparation/C1101.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing external flow logs to gather information about network traffic and communications. It is essential for understanding the context of incidents and identifying potential threats or anomalies in the network. |
| [Access External DNS Logs](C1106.md) | [C1106](../../capability/preparation/C1106.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access external DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. External DNS logs differ from internal DNS logs as they capture communication from internal systems to external domains, providing insights into outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration attempts. |
| [Establish Ability to Block Internal IP Addresses](C1112.md) | [C1112](../../capability/preparation/C1112.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block internal IP addresses that are deemed malicious or pose a threat to the organization's network. This includes configuring firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other security appliances to effectively block traffic from these internal IP addresses. It is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks from within the organization. |
| [Establish Ability to Block User External Communication](C1119.md) | [C1119](../../capability/preparation/C1119.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block user external communication that is deemed malicious or poses a threat to the organization's network. This includes configuring firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other security appliances to effectively block traffic from users to external entities. It is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks from external sources. |
| [Establish Ability to Block User Internal Communication](C1120.md) | [C1120](../../capability/preparation/C1120.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block user internal communication that is deemed malicious or poses a threat to the organization's network. This includes configuring firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other security appliances to effectively block traffic from users to internal entities. It is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks from within the organization. |
| [Establish Ability to Delete Email Message](C1205.md) | [C1205](../../capability/preparation/C1205.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to delete email messages. This is crucial for maintaining email hygiene, ensuring that sensitive or irrelevant emails can be removed from the system, and preventing potential data breaches. The capability includes implementing mechanisms to identify and delete specific email messages, ensuring that these deletions are enforced across the organization's email systems, and maintaining an audit trail of deleted messages to enhance security posture. |
| [Establish Ability to Quarantine File by Hash](C1313.md) | [C1313](../../capability/preparation/C1313.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to quarantine a file by its hash within a system or network. This includes implementing mechanisms to isolate files based on their unique hash values, ensuring that potentially harmful files can be effectively contained and managed. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, preventing the spread of malware, and enhancing overall security posture by providing a controlled environment for suspicious files. |
| [Unblock Domain on Email](C5201.md) | [C5201](../../capability/recovery/C5201.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking a domain that has been previously blocked on email systems due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the domain is no longer a threat, and updating email filtering rules accordingly. |
| [Unblock Sender on Email](C5202.md) | [C5202](../../capability/recovery/C5202.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking a sender that has been previously blocked on email systems due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the sender is no longer a threat, and updating email filtering rules accordingly. |
| [Restore Quarantined Email Message](C5203.md) | [C5203](../../capability/recovery/C5203.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of restoring a quarantined email message. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the email, ensuring it does not pose a security risk, and executing the restoration process to allow the user to access the message. |
