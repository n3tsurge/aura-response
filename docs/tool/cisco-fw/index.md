## Capabilities

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Access External Flow Logs](C1101.md) | [C1101](../../capability/C1101.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing external flow logs to gather information about network traffic and communications. It is essential for understanding the context of incidents and identifying potential threats or anomalies in the network. |
| [Access Internal Flow Logs](C1102.md) | [C1102](../../capability/C1102.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing internal flow logs to gather information about network traffic and communications. It is essential for understanding the context of incidents and identifying potential threats or anomalies in the network. |
| [Access Internal HTTP Logs](C1103.md) | [C1103](../../capability/C1103.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing internal HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access External HTTP Logs](C1104.md) | [C1104](../../capability/C1104.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing external HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access Internal DNS Logs](C1105.md) | [C1105](../../capability/C1105.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access internal DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. |
| [Access External DNS Logs](C1106.md) | [C1106](../../capability/C1106.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access external DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. External DNS logs differ from internal DNS logs as they capture communication from internal systems to external domains, providing insights into outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration attempts. |
| [Access Internal Packet Capture Data](C1109.md) | [C1109](../../capability/C1109.md) | Preparation | This capability outlines the process for accessing internal packet capture data, which is crucial for analyzing network traffic and identifying potential security incidents.  Internal packet data highlights traffic flowing from internal assets to internal destinations. It serves as a guide for incident response teams to effectively gather and utilize internal packet capture data during the preparation phase of incident response. |
