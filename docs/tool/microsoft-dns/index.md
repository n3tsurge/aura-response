| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Access Internal DNS Logs](C1105.md) | [C1105](../../capability/preparation/C1105.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access internal DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. |
| [Access External DNS Logs](C1106.md) | [C1106](../../capability/preparation/C1106.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access external DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. External DNS logs differ from internal DNS logs as they capture communication from internal systems to external domains, providing insights into outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration attempts. |
| [Establish Ability to Block External Domains](C1113.md) | [C1113](../../capability/preparation/C1113.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block external domain names that are deemed malicious or pose a threat to the organization's network. This includes configuring DNS filtering, firewalls, and other security appliances to effectively block access to these domains. It is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks from external sources. |
| [Establish Ability to Block Internal Domains](C1114.md) | [C1114](../../capability/preparation/C1114.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block internal domain names that are deemed malicious or pose a threat to the organization's network. This includes configuring DNS filtering, firewalls, and other security appliances to effectively block access to these domains. It is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks from within the organization. |
| [Establish Ability to Block Email Domain](C1203.md) | [C1203](../../capability/preparation/C1203.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to block email domains. This is crucial for preventing phishing attacks, spam, and other malicious activities that can originate from specific domains. The capability includes implementing mechanisms to identify and block emails from specified domains, ensuring that these blocks are enforced across the organization's email systems, and maintaining an updated list of blocked domains to enhance security posture. |
| [Block External Domain](C3103.md) | [C3103](../../capability/containment/C3103.md) | Containment | This capability involves blocking external domains that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through DNS filtering, firewall rules, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic to these domains is denied. |
| [Block Internal Domain](C3104.md) | [C3104](../../capability/containment/C3104.md) | Containment | This capability involves blocking internal domains that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from within the network. This capability can be implemented through DNS filtering, firewall rules, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic to these internal domains is denied. |
| [Block Email Domain](C3201.md) | [C3201](../../capability/containment/C3201.md) | Containment | This capability involves blocking email communication from specific domains that are identified as malicious or potentially harmful. This is a critical containment measure to prevent phishing attacks, spam, and other malicious activities that can compromise the security of the organization. It can be implemented through email filtering systems, firewalls, or other network security measures that inspect incoming email traffic and block messages from specified domains. |
| [Unblock Blocked Domain](C5102.md) | [C5102](../../capability/recovery/C5102.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking a domain that has been previously blocked due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the domain is no longer a threat, and updating DNS or security rules accordingly. |
| [Unblock Domain on Email](C5201.md) | [C5201](../../capability/recovery/C5201.md) | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking a domain that has been previously blocked on email systems due to security concerns. It includes steps for verifying the legitimacy of the unblock request, ensuring that the domain is no longer a threat, and updating email filtering rules accordingly. |
