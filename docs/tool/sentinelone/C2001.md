# List Alert Victims

## Overview

This tool capability allows stakeholders to list all victims affected by the incident using SentinelOne. It provides a comprehensive overview of those impacted, enabling better resource allocation and response planning.

### How to List Alert Victims via SentinelOne Console (GUI)

1. **Log into the SentinelOne Management Console.**
2. Navigate to the **'Incidents'** or **'Threats'** tab depending on how your console is configured.
3. Apply relevant **filters** such as date range, threat type, severity, or site.
4. Click on an individual incident or alert to open its detail view.
5. Within the detail pane, locate the **'Affected Endpoints'**, **'Agent'**, or **'User'** sections. These contain victim information:
   - `Machine Name`
   - `Username`
   - `Group Name` or `Site`
6. Use the **'Export'** button (top-right) to download the full victim list as a CSV if needed.
7. Optionally, use the **'Comment'** or **'Tag'** features to track and annotate victim systems.

This method enables quick identification of affected assets directly within the SentinelOne UI.
