# List Hosts Establishing Connections

## Overview

This tool capability allows stakeholders to identify hosts that are establishing network connections using SentinelOne's Event Search and Deep Visibility features. It provides insights into connection patterns and potential lateral movement.

## Workflow

### How to List Hosts Establishing Connections via SentinelOne Console (GUI)

1. **Log into the SentinelOne Management Console.**
2. Navigate to **'Event Search'** in the sidebar.
3. Use the **EDR** or **XDR** view for parsed data analysis.
4. Configure search queries to identify connection patterns:
   ```
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and event.network.direction = 'OUTGOING'
   event.type = 'Process Creation' and tgt.process.name contains 'chrome.exe'
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and src.ip.address starts_with '192.168.'
   ```
5. Analyze connection data to identify:
   - `src.ip.address` - host initiating connections
   - `dst.ip.address` - destination IP addresses
   - `src.process.name` - process making connections
   - `src.process.user` - user account context
   - `dst.port.number` - destination ports
   - `event.network.protocol` - network protocol
   - `event.network.connectionStatus` - connection status
6. Use **PowerQuery** for advanced analysis:
   ```
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and event.network.direction = 'OUTGOING' | group ConnectionCount = count() by src.ip.address, dst.ip.address | sort -ConnectionCount
   ```
7. Apply **Threat Intelligence** overlays to identify malicious destinations.
8. Export results for further analysis and reporting.

### Using SentinelOne API

```bash
# Query network connection events via API
curl -X GET "https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/cloud-funnel/events" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]" \
  -G -d "query=event.type = 'IP Connect' and event.network.direction = 'OUTGOING'" \
  -d "limit=1000"
```

### PowerQuery for Advanced Network Analysis

```sql
| filter(EventType = "Ip Connect" AND Direction = "Outgoing")
| group ConnectionCount = count(), DistinctDestinations = estimate_distinct(DstIP) by SrcIP, SrcProcName
| filter(DistinctDestinations > 10)
| sort -ConnectionCount
```

This provides comprehensive visibility into host connection patterns using SentinelOne's S1QL 2.0 query language for threat hunting and incident analysis.
