# Analyze IP Communication

## Overview

This tool capability allows stakeholders to analyze IP communication patterns using SentinelOne's Deep Visibility and network monitoring features. It provides detailed insights into network connections, traffic patterns, and potential threats.

## Workflow

### How to Analyze IP Communication via SentinelOne Console (GUI)

1. **Log into the SentinelOne Management Console.**
2. Navigate to the **'Visibility'** tab and select **'Deep Visibility'**.
3. Use the **'Events'** view to filter network-related activities:
   - Set event type filter to **'Network'** or **'IP'**
   - Apply time range filters for the investigation period
   - Filter by specific IP addresses using **'srcIp'** or **'dstIp'** fields
4. Examine the network connection events to identify:
   - `Source IP Address` - originating IP
   - `Destination IP Address` - target IP
   - `Protocol` - TCP/UDP/ICMP
   - `Port Numbers` - source and destination ports
   - `Process Information` - process making the connection
   - `Timestamp` - when connection occurred
5. Use **'Advanced Queries'** for complex analysis:
   ```
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and (src.ip.address contains '192.168.' or dst.ip.address contains '10.0.')
   ```
6. Export results using the **'Export'** button for further analysis.
7. Correlate with threat intelligence using **'Threat Intelligence'** integration.

### Using SentinelOne API

```bash
# Query network events via API
curl -X GET "https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/dv/events" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]" \
  -G -d "eventTypes=ip" \
  -d "limit=1000" \
  -d "createdAt__gte=2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"
```

This provides comprehensive visibility into IP-level network communications for threat analysis.
