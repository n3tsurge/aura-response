# List Data Transferred

## Overview

This tool capability allows stakeholders to identify and list data transfer activities using SentinelOne's file monitoring and network visibility features. It helps track file movements, uploads, downloads, and potential data exfiltration.

## Workflow

### How to List Data Transferred via SentinelOne Console (GUI)

1. **Log into the SentinelOne Management Console.**
2. Navigate to the **'Visibility'** tab and select **'Deep Visibility'**.
3. Configure filters for data transfer analysis:
   - Set event types to **'File'**, **'Network'**, and **'Process'**
   - Apply time range for investigation period
   - Filter by file operations: **'Copy'**, **'Move'**, **'Upload'**, **'Download'**
4. Use advanced queries to track data transfers:
   ```
   event.type = 'File Modification' and (file.operation = 'Copy' or file.operation = 'Move')
   event.type = 'Process Creation' and process.name contains 'ftp' and process.cmdline contains 'put'
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and dst.port in (21, 22, 80, 443) and event.network.bytesSent > 1000000
   ```
5. Analyze transfer events to identify:
   - `File Path` - source and destination paths
   - `File Size` - size of transferred files
   - `Transfer Method` - mechanism used (FTP, HTTP, SMB, email)
   - `User Context` - user performing the transfer
   - `Process Name` - application used for transfer
   - `Network Destination` - external transfer targets
   - `Transfer Timestamp` - when transfer occurred
6. Use **'File Integrity Monitoring'** to track file movements.
7. Correlate with **'Network Events'** to identify upload/download activities.
8. Apply **'DLP Integration'** if available for sensitive data detection.
9. Export transfer logs for compliance and forensic analysis.

### Using SentinelOne API

```bash
# Query file transfer events
curl -X GET "https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/dv/events" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]" \
  -G -d "eventTypes=file,process,ip" \
  -d "queryFilter=file.operation in ('Copy', 'Move')" \
  -d "limit=1000"
```

### Advanced Query Examples

```sql
-- Large file transfers
EventType = "File" AND FileSize > 100000000 AND FileOperation = "Copy"

-- Network uploads
EventType = "IP" AND DstPort In ("80", "443") AND BytesSent > 10000000

-- USB/Removable media transfers
EventType = "File" AND FilePath Contains "E:\" AND FileOperation = "Copy"
```

This provides comprehensive visibility into data movement activities for DLP and security analysis.
