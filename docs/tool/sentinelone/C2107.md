# List Hosts Communicating by Port

## Overview

This tool capability allows stakeholders to identify hosts communicating over specific ports using SentinelOne's Deep Visibility network monitoring. It helps analyze port-based communication patterns and identify potential security threats.

## Workflow

### How to List Hosts Communicating by Port via SentinelOne Console (GUI)

1. **Log into the SentinelOne Management Console.**
2. Navigate to the **'Visibility'** tab and select **'Deep Visibility'**.
3. Configure network event filters:
   - Set event type to **'Network'**
   - Use **'Port'** or **'DstPort'** filters to specify the target port
   - Apply time range for the investigation period
4. Create advanced queries for port-specific analysis:
   ```
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and dst.port = 443
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and (dst.port = 80 or dst.port = 8080)
   event.type = 'IP Connect' and src.port = 22
   ```
5. Analyze the results to identify:
   - `Source Host IP` - hosts initiating connections
   - `Destination Host IP` - target hosts
   - `Port Number` - specific port being used
   - `Protocol` - TCP/UDP protocol type
   - `Process Name` - application making the connection
   - `User Context` - user account associated with the process
   - `Connection Frequency` - how often connections occur
6. Use **'Group By'** functionality to aggregate results by:
   - Source IP addresses
   - Destination ports
   - Process names
7. Export findings using the **'Export'** button for reporting.
8. Set up **'Custom Rules'** for ongoing monitoring of suspicious port activity.

### Using SentinelOne API

```bash
# Query hosts communicating on specific port
curl -X GET "https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/dv/events" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]" \
  -G -d "eventTypes=ip" \
  -d "queryFilter=dst.port = 443" \
  -d "limit=1000"
```

This enables comprehensive port-based network traffic analysis for security investigations.
