# Restore System from Backup

## Overview

This tool capability allows stakeholders to restore systems from backup using SentinelOne's Rollback Engine and system recovery features. It provides comprehensive system restoration capabilities for rapid recovery from security incidents.

## Workflow

### How to Restore System from Backup via SentinelOne Console (GUI)

1. **Log into the SentinelOne Management Console.**
2. Navigate to **'Threats'** to identify threats requiring system restoration.
3. Assess the scope of system compromise:
   - Review threat timeline and affected files
   - Analyze system changes and modifications
   - Determine restoration point requirements
4. Use **'Rollback Engine'** for automated restoration:
   - Navigate to threat details
   - Select **'Rollback'** action
   - Choose restoration scope:
     - **File System Rollback**: Restore modified/deleted files
     - **Registry Rollback**: Restore registry changes
     - **Process Rollback**: Terminate malicious processes
5. For manual system analysis and restoration:
   - Navigate to **'Deep Visibility'** for forensic review
   - Use **'Event Search'** to identify system changes:
     ```
     event.type = 'File Modification' and tgt.file.path contains 'C:\Windows'
     event.type = 'Registry Value Set' and tgt.registry.path contains 'HKLM'
     event.type = 'Service Install' and src.process.name != 'services.exe'
     ```
6. Coordinate with backup systems:
   - Export affected file lists from SentinelOne
   - Identify backup restoration requirements
   - Plan restoration sequence and dependencies
7. Monitor restoration progress and verify system integrity.
8. Validate system functionality post-restoration.

### Using SentinelOne API for System Restoration

```bash
# Initiate automatic rollback
curl -X POST "https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/threats/actions/rollback" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "filter": {
      "ids": ["threat-id-here"]
    },
    "data": {
      "rollbackType": "full"
    }
  }'

# Get rollback status
curl -X GET "https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/activities" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]" \
  -G -d "activityTypes=23" \
  -d "agentIds=agent-id-here"
```

### PowerQuery for System Change Analysis

```sql
# Identify all system modifications for restoration planning
event.type in ('File Modification', 'File Creation', 'File Deletion') and (tgt.file.path contains 'C:\Windows' or tgt.file.path contains 'C:\Program Files') | group ChangeCount = count() by event.type, src.process.name | sort -ChangeCount
```

### Registry Change Analysis for Restoration

```sql
# Analyze registry modifications requiring restoration
event.type in ('Registry Key Create', 'Registry Value Set', 'Registry Key Delete') and (tgt.registry.path contains 'HKLM' or tgt.registry.path contains 'HKCU') and src.process.name not in ('svchost.exe', 'winlogon.exe') | project event.time, event.type, tgt.registry.path, tgt.registry.value, src.process.name
```

### Service and Startup Item Analysis

```sql
# Identify unauthorized service installations
event.type = 'Service Install' and src.process.name not in ('services.exe', 'sc.exe') | project event.time, service.name, service.path, src.process.name, src.process.user

# Monitor startup item modifications
event.type = 'Registry Value Set' and tgt.registry.path contains 'Run' | project event.time, tgt.registry.path, tgt.registry.value, src.process.name
```

### Post-Restoration Verification

```sql
# Verify system restoration success
event.type = 'Rollback Complete' and rollback.status = 'Success' | group RestorationCount = count() by rollback.type, agent.name | sort -RestorationCount

# Monitor for re-infection after restoration
event.type = 'Threat Detection' and event.time > 'restoration-time' | project threat.name, threat.type, agent.name, event.time
```

### Integration with External Backup Systems

```bash
# Export affected file list for external backup restoration
curl -X GET "https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/cloud-funnel/events" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]" \
  -G -d "query=event.type = 'File Modification' and tgt.file.path contains 'C:\Users'" \
  -d "limit=10000" | jq '.data[].tgt.file.path' > affected_files.txt
```
