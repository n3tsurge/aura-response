# Access External HTTP Logs

## Overview

This capability allows the tool to access external HTTP logs, which can be crucial for identifying and analyzing security incidents. By examining these logs, security teams can gain insights into potential threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach.

## Workflow

External HTTP logs can be accessed through the SentinelOne Event Search page in the user interface. The following steps outline the process:

1. **Navigate to the Event Search Page**: Open the SentinelOne console and go to the Event Search section.
2. **Search for Events**: Use the search functionality to filter events based on criteria such as `url.address` or `event.url.action`.
3. **Review Results**: Analyze the search results to identify relevant events that may indicate security incidents or user activities of interest.
4. **Export Data**: If necessary, export the search results for further analysis or reporting.

This capability is essential for security analysts and incident responders to monitor and investigate web-related activities within the network.
