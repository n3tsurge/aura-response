## Capabilities

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Access internal HTTP Logs](T0001/C1103.md) | [C1103](../capability/C1103.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing internal HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access External HTTP Logs](T0001/C1104.md) | [C1104](../capability/C1104.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing external HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access Internal DNS Logs](T0001/C1105.md) | [C1105](../capability/C1105.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access internal DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach.

## Workflow

Internal DNS logs can be accessed through the SentinelOne Event Search page in the user interface. The following steps outline the process:

1. **Navigate to the Event Search Page**: Open the SentinelOne console and go to the Event Search section.
2. **Search for Events**: Use the search functionality to filter events based on criteria such as `dns.query.name` or `dns.response.code`.
3. **Review Results**: Analyze the search results to identify relevant DNS queries and responses that may indicate security incidents or unusual activities.
4. **Export Data**: If necessary, export the search results for further analysis or reporting.

This capability is essential for security analysts and incident responders to monitor and investigate DNS-related activities within the network. |
| [List Alert Victims](T0001/C2001.md) | [C2001](../capability/C2001.md) | Identification | This capability allows for stakeholders to list all victims affected by the incident. It provides a comprehensive overview of those impacted, enabling better resource allocation and response planning. |
| [List host vulnerabilities](T0001/C2002.md) | [C2002](../capability/C2002.md) | Identification | This capability involves the ability to identify and list vulnerabilities present on hosts within a network. It includes scanning for known vulnerabilities, assessing their severity, and compiling a report of findings to inform remediation efforts. |
| [List Registry Key Modifications](T0001/C2501.md) | [C2501](../capability/C2501.md) | Identification | This capability allows the incident responder and security analyst to list modifications made to registry keys. This is crucial for identifying unauthorized changes that may indicate malicious activity or system misconfiguration. The capability provides a means to track changes over time, aiding in forensic analysis and incident response. |
