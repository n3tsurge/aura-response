## Capabilities

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Access Vulnerability Management System Logs](T0001/C1013.md) | [C1013](../capability/C1013.md) | Preparation | This is a template for capabilities that can be used to define specific actions or processes within a phase. It serves as a starting point for creating detailed capability specifications. |
| [Access internal HTTP Logs](T0001/C1103.md) | [C1103](../capability/C1103.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing internal HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access External HTTP Logs](T0001/C1104.md) | [C1104](../capability/C1104.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing external HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access Internal DNS Logs](T0001/C1105.md) | [C1105](../capability/C1105.md) | Preparation | This capability allows security teams to access internal DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. |
| [List Alert Victims](T0001/C2001.md) | [C2001](../capability/C2001.md) | Identification | This capability allows for stakeholders to list all victims affected by the incident. It provides a comprehensive overview of those impacted, enabling better resource allocation and response planning. |
| [List Host Vulnerabilities](T0001/C2002.md) | [C2002](../capability/C2002.md) | Identification | This capability involves the ability to identify and list vulnerabilities present on hosts within a network. It includes scanning for known vulnerabilities, assessing their severity, and compiling a report of findings to inform remediation efforts. |
| [List Registry Key Modifications](T0001/C2501.md) | [C2501](../capability/C2501.md) | Identification | This capability allows the incident responder and security analyst to list modifications made to registry keys. This is crucial for identifying unauthorized changes that may indicate malicious activity or system misconfiguration. The capability provides a means to track changes over time, aiding in forensic analysis and incident response. |
