| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Establish a Communication Map](C1007.md) | [C1007](../../capability/preparation/C1007.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing a communication map that outlines how information will be shared during an incident. It includes identifying key stakeholders, defining communication channels, and ensuring that all parties understand their roles in the communication process. This is essential for effective coordination and response during security incidents. |
| [Access Vulnerability Management System Logs](C1013.md) | [C1013](../../capability/preparation/C1013.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing logs from the vulnerability management system to identify any anomalies or unauthorized activities related to vulnerability assessments and remediation efforts. It is crucial for understanding the security posture of the organization and detecting potential security incidents. |
| [Access External Flow Logs](C1101.md) | [C1101](../../capability/preparation/C1101.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing external flow logs to gather information about network traffic and communications. It is essential for understanding the context of incidents and identifying potential threats or anomalies in the network. |
| [Access Internal HTTP Logs](C1103.md) | [C1103](../../capability/preparation/C1103.md) | Preparation | This capability involves accessing and reviewing internal HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access Internal Packet Capture Data](C1109.md) | [C1109](../../capability/preparation/C1109.md) | Preparation | This capability outlines the process for accessing internal packet capture data, which is crucial for analyzing network traffic and identifying potential security incidents.  Internal packet data highlights traffic flowing from internal assets to internal destinations. It serves as a guide for incident response teams to effectively gather and utilize internal packet capture data during the preparation phase of incident response. |
| [Establish Ability to Identify Data Transferred](C1125.md) | [C1125](../../capability/preparation/C1125.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to identify data that has been transferred across networks or systems. This includes implementing mechanisms to recognize and classify transferred data, ensuring that all data can be accurately identified and monitored. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, compliance with regulations, and enhancing overall security posture by providing visibility into data movement within the organization. |
| [Establish Ability to List Firewall Rules](C1128.md) | [C1128](../../capability/preparation/C1128.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to list firewall rules that are currently in place within a network. This is crucial for understanding the security posture of the network, ensuring that the firewall is configured correctly, and identifying any potential gaps or misconfigurations in the firewall rules. The capability includes implementing mechanisms to retrieve and display the current firewall rules, ensuring that they are up-to-date and aligned with organizational security policies. |
| [Establish Ability to Find File by Format](C1309.md) | [C1309](../../capability/preparation/C1309.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to find a file by its format within a system or network. This includes implementing mechanisms to identify and categorize files based on their format, ensuring that all files can be efficiently accessed and managed according to their type. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, facilitating quick access to necessary files, and enhancing overall operational efficiency by providing visibility into file formats within the organization. |
| [Establish Ability to Find File by Content Pattern](C1310.md) | [C1310](../../capability/preparation/C1310.md) | Preparation | This capability involves establishing the ability to find a file by its content pattern within a system or network. This includes implementing mechanisms to analyze and identify specific content patterns within files, ensuring that all files can be efficiently accessed and managed based on their content. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, facilitating quick access to necessary files, and enhancing overall operational efficiency by providing visibility into file contents within the organization. |
| [List Host Vulnerabilities](C2002.md) | [C2002](../../capability/identification/C2002.md) | Identification | This capability involves the ability to identify and list vulnerabilities present on hosts within a network. It includes scanning for known vulnerabilities, assessing their severity, and compiling a report of findings to inform remediation efforts. |
