# Phishing Email Response

## Overview

This playbook outlines the steps to respond to a phishing email incident. It includes identification, containment, eradication, and recovery procedures to mitigate the impact of phishing attacks on the organization.

## Workflow

### Identification

After initial report of potential phishing, the following actions should be taken to qualify and quantify the scope of the perceived threat.

1. Collect all recipients of the suspicious e-mail
2. Identify any variations of the suspicious e-mail
3. Collect all senders, domains, urls, IP addresses associated with potential attack infrastructure
4. Analyze each artifact to determine its threat value
5. Enrich the artifacts with information necessary to narrow attribution to specific phishing campaigns, source countries, etc.
6. Determine if any users have interacted with target infrastructure and fallen victim to the phishing campaign
   - If telemetry is unavailable to determine if a user has interacted with the phishing e-mail consider erring on the side of caution when applying the steps in the **Containment** phase.

### Containment

1. Temporarily block e-mail from the associated sender addresses
2. Based on the analysis of the collected artifacts, perform the following actions:
   - Block communication with external IP addresses
   - Block communication with external domains
   - Block communication with external URLs
   - Block inbound mail from source IP addresse
   - Block inbound mail from source senders
3. Temporarily lock any users that have fallen for the phishing campaign

### Eradication

1. Remove the malicious e-mail from all recipients
2. Revoke all sessions for impacted users
3. Reset the password for all impacted users

### Recovery

1. Unlock any users that were locked during the event
2. Unblock any artifacts that were improperly or accidentally blocked

### Lessons Learned

1. Analyze the pattern for which the phishing e-mail circumvented security controls
2. Produce a report of recommended configuration changes to prevent future circumvention
3. Produce a list of potential early warning indicators/detections to detect the circumvention of security controls
