# Overview

The AURA project aims to create a unified structure for mapping security operations, detection, response, and remediation across various security tools, frameworks, and standards. This project is designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations by providing a standardized approach to incident response.

## Key Features

- **Unified Response Framework**: A comprehensive framework that integrates various security tools and standards.
- **Adaptive Response**: The framework adapts to different security scenarios, providing tailored responses based on the context of the incident.
- **Standardized Mapping**: A structured approach to map security detections and responses across different platforms and frameworks.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Detailed documentation and examples to guide users in implementing the framework effectively.

## Component ID Taxonomy

Every component in the AURA Response framework is assigned a unique identifier based on its type and function. This taxonomy ensures consistency and clarity in referencing components across the documentation and implementation. As well as a friendly name and identifier for each component, a UUID is also assigned to each component to ensure uniqueness across the entire framework. This allows for easy tracking and management of components within the AURA Response ecosystem.

### Examples

- `PB0001`: Response Playbook
- `C0001`: Response Capability
- `T0001`: Cyber Security Tools
- `F0001`: IT, CyberSecurity, or Compliance Frameworks
- `P0001`: Incident Response Phases
- `S0001`: Incident Response Stakeholders for actionable tasks or reporting

## Components

- **[Response Playbooks](documentation/playbooks.md)**: Structured guides for managing security incidents, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to remediation.
- **[Response Capability](documentation/capability.md)**: A set of capabilities that every security team should have to effectively detect, analyze, and respond to security threats.
- **[Response Tools](documentation/tools.md)**: A comprehensive set of utilities and frameworks designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security incident response.
- **[Response Phases](documentation/phases.md)**: A structured approach to incident response, including preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review.
- **[Response Frameworks](documentation/frameworks.md)**: Integration with established security frameworks and standards to ensure compliance and best practices in incident management.
