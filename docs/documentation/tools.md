# Response Tools

## Overview

The response tools in the AURA project provide a comprehensive set of utilities and frameworks designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security incident response. These tools are structured to support various phases of incident management, from detection to remediation, ensuring a unified approach across different security platforms.  For example, popular EDR tools like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, and Microsoft Defender are integrated into the framework, allowing for seamless response actions based on the context of each incident.

## Maturity Rating

The maturity rating for a tool is determined by the organization generating the documentation leveraging the AURA framework. This rating reflects the organization's maturity of deploying the tool in multiple categories such as management, deployment scope, etc. The maturity rating is a crucial aspect of the AURA framework, as it helps organizations understand the effectiveness and readiness of their security tools in responding to incidents.

### Maturity Areas

- **Management**: How well the tool is managed within the organization.
- **Deployment Scope**: The extent to which the tool is deployed across the organization.
- **Functionality**: The range of features and capabilities the tool offers.
- **Knowledge**: The level of expertise and understanding the organization has regarding the tool's operation and best practices.
- **Lifecycle**: The tool's lifecycle management, including updates that keep up with evolving threats and technologies.
- **Vendor Risk**: The assessment of risks associated with the vendor providing the tool, including their security practices and reliability.  Essentially, will the tool continue to be available and supported when needed.
