# Response Playbooks

## Overview

The response playbooks in the AURA project provide a structured and adaptive framework for managing security incidents. These playbooks are designed to guide security teams through the various phases of incident response, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to remediation. Each playbook is tailored to specific types of incidents, integrating with various security tools and platforms to facilitate a unified response.

## Tool Integration

The playbooks leverage a wide range of security tools that are correlated to the individual capabilities required for effective handling of the playbook's incident type.  By aligning tools with specific capabilities, an organization can quickly identify the most effective tools for each scenario, whether the organization can even perform the scenario handling as defined in the playbook, or if the organization needs to adjust the playbook to fit their capabilities.
