# Response Stakeholder

## Overview

The response stakeholder documentation in the AURA project provides a comprehensive guide to the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders involved in the incident response process. This documentation is designed to ensure that all parties understand their roles, facilitating effective communication and collaboration during security incidents.

An example of a stakeholder might include security analysts, incident response teams, IT operations, and management. Each stakeholder has specific responsibilities that contribute to the overall success of the incident response process.
