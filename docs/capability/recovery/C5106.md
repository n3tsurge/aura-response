## Overview
This capability involves restoring communication capabilities for users who were previously blocked during incident containment. This recovery action is essential to restore normal operations while ensuring the user account is secure and no longer compromised. It includes removing network blocks, communication restrictions, and access controls that were implemented as containment measures.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- system-administrator

## Requirements
For a tool, system or staff perform this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

| Requirement ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C5106-C5106-REQ-4 | Documentation of the original blocking actions to ensure complete and accurate restoration of user capabilities. | Documentation|
| C5106-C5106-REQ-2 | Knowledge of which specific users were blocked and the scope of their restrictions during the incident containment phase. | Knowledge|
| C5106-C5106-REQ-3 | Verification procedures to ensure the user account is secure and no longer compromised before unblocking. | Procedure|
| C5106-C5106-REQ-1 | Access to network security tools, firewalls, or user management systems that can remove user communication blocks. | System|

## Enrichment
| Enrichment ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C5106-C5106-ENR-1 | User Activity Analysis - Analyze user activity patterns and authentication logs to confirm the account is secure before unblocking. | Analysis |
| C5106-C5106-ENR-2 | Network Traffic Validation - Monitor network traffic patterns to ensure unblocked users are not exhibiting suspicious communication behavior. | Monitoring |

## Hunting
| Hunting ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C5106-C5106-HUN-1 | Residual Compromise Detection - Hunt for signs of residual compromise or persistent access mechanisms that may still affect the unblocked user. | Detection |
| C5106-C5106-HUN-2 | Lateral Movement Monitoring - Monitor for potential lateral movement attempts from newly unblocked user accounts. | Behavioral |

## Fields
| Field ID | Name | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C5106-FLD-1 | C5106-FLD-1 | User ID - The unique identifier of the user being unblocked. | string |
| C5106-FLD-2 | C5106-FLD-2 | Block Type - The type of block being removed (network, communication, access control). | string |
| C5106-FLD-3 | C5106-FLD-3 | Original Block Reason - The reason why the user was originally blocked during containment. | string |
| C5106-FLD-4 | C5106-FLD-4 | Unblock Timestamp - The date and time when the user was unblocked. | datetime |
| C5106-FLD-5 | C5106-FLD-5 | System Hostname - The hostname or identifier of the system where the unblock action was performed. | string |
| C5106-FLD-6 | C5106-FLD-6 | Authorizing Personnel - The incident response team member who authorized the unblock action. | string |

## Automation
This section provides information on how the capability can be automated.
