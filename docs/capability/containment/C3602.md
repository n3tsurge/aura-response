&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C3602-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Containment_%28P0003%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Identity-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves removing specific permissions from a user account to limit their access to systems and data. This action is typically taken in response to suspicious activity or when a user account is compromised. Removing permissions helps to contain the incident and prevent potential damage while further investigation is conducted. It is an essential step in the incident response process to protect sensitive information and maintain security.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- security-analyst
- identity-administrator
- incident-responder
- scribe
- incident-commander

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- identity-administrator
- incident-responder

## Requirements
For a tool, system or staff perform this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

| Requirement ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C3602-C3602-REQ-1 | Authority and access permissions to implement containment measures. | Authorization|
| C3602-C3602-REQ-2 | Technical capability and tools to execute containment actions effectively. | System|
| C3602-C3602-REQ-3 | Procedures to validate containment effectiveness and monitor for bypass attempts. | Validation|

## Automation
This section provides information on how the capability can be automated.

| Automation ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C3602-AUT-1 | Automated scripts or tools to remove user permissions based on predefined criteria or alerts. | Script |
| C3602-AUT-2 | Integration with identity and access management (IAM) systems to streamline the permission removal process.  Considerations for SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) for automated user management. | Integration |
