## Overview
This capability ensures that the system does not allow access to IO ports that are not explicitly defined in the system's configuration. This is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and potential exploitation of system vulnerabilities through IO ports.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Requirements
For a tool, system or staff perform this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

| Requirement ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C3502-C3502-REQ-1 | Authority and access permissions to implement containment measures. | Authorization|
| C3502-C3502-REQ-2 | Technical capability and tools to execute containment actions effectively. | System|
