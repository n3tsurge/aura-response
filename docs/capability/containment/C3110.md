## Overview
This capability involves blocking internal communication for specific users who are identified as potential threats or who have been compromised. This is a critical containment measure to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data and to stop further malicious activities from these users. It can be implemented through user account restrictions, firewall rules, or other network security measures to ensure that these users cannot communicate with internal networks.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Requirements
For a tool, system or staff perform this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

| Requirement ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C3110-C3110-REQ-1 | Authority and access permissions to implement containment measures. | Authorization|
