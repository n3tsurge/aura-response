## Overview
This capability involves locking a user account to prevent further access to systems and data. This action is typically taken in response to suspicious activity or when a user account is compromised. Locking the account helps to contain the incident and prevent potential damage while further investigation is conducted. It is an essential step in the incident response process to protect sensitive information and maintain security.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
