&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C3001-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Containment_%28P0003%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-General-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves applying patches to systems and applications to remediate identified vulnerabilities. It ensures that all software is up-to-date with the latest security fixes, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation by adversaries. This process includes identifying vulnerable components, testing patches in a controlled environment, and deploying them across the affected systems.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
