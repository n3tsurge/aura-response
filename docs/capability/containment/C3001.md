## Overview
This capability involves applying patches to systems and applications to remediate identified vulnerabilities. It ensures that all software is up-to-date with the latest security fixes, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation by adversaries. This process includes identifying vulnerable components, testing patches in a controlled environment, and deploying them across the affected systems.
