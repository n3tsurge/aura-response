## Overview
This capability involves blocking internal IP addresses that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from within the network. This capability can be implemented through firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic from these internal IP addresses is denied.

## Tools
The following tools provide this capability:

- [Cisco Firewall (ASA/NGFW)](../tool/cisco-fw/C3102.md)
- [Guardicore](../tool/guardicore/C3102.md)
- [Palo Alto Firewall](../tool/palo-alto-fw/C3102.md)
- [SentinelOne](../tool/sentinelone/C3102.md)
