# Block Internal IP Address
&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C3102-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Containment_%28P0003%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves blocking internal IP addresses that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from within the network. This capability can be implemented through firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic from these internal IP addresses is denied.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder

| Block Timestamp | Date and time when the IP address was blocked |
| Threat Indicator | Specific threat or malicious activity associated with the IP |
| Network Segment | Network segment or VLAN where the IP address is located |
| Host Information | Host details associated with the IP address |
| Block Scope | Scope of the block (subnet-wide, host-specific, port-specific) |
| Containment Method | Method used to block the IP (ACL, firewall rule, VLAN isolation) |
| Impact Assessment | Assessment of potential impact on business operations |
| Authorized By | Person or system that authorized the IP block |
| Associated User | User account associated with the IP address if known |
