## Overview
This capability involves blocking internal URLs that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from within the network. This capability can be implemented through web filtering, firewall rules, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic to these internal URLs is denied.
