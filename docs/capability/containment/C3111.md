# Block Data Transfer by Content Pattern
&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C3111-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Containment_%28P0003%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves blocking data transfers based on specific content patterns that are identified as sensitive or potentially harmful. This is a critical containment measure to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data and to stop further malicious activities. It can be implemented through network security measures such as data loss prevention (DLP) systems, firewalls, or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that inspect data traffic and block transfers that match predefined patterns.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
