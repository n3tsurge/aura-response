# Block External IP Address
&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C3101-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Containment_%28P0003%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves blocking external IP addresses that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic from these IP addresses is denied.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder

| C3101-C3101-REQ-2 | Technical capability and tools to execute containment actions effectively. | System|
| C3101-C3101-REQ-4 | Network monitoring tools and access to network infrastructure for analysis and control. | System|
| C3101-C3101-REQ-3 | Procedures to validate containment effectiveness and monitor for bypass attempts. | Validation|

## Fields
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| IP Address | The external IP address to be blocked |
| Block Timestamp | Date and time when the IP address was blocked |
| Threat Category | Category of threat associated with the IP address (malware, phishing, botnet, etc.) |
| Threat Intelligence Source | Source that identified the IP as malicious (feed name, vendor, etc.) |
| Block Method | Method used to block the IP (firewall rule, IPS, DNS sinkhole, etc.) |
| Geographic Location | Geographic location of the blocked IP address |
| ASN Information | Autonomous System Number and organization information |
| Block Duration | Duration for which the IP address is blocked (permanent, temporary, time-based) |
| Authorized By | Person or system that authorized the IP block |
| Associated IOCs | Other indicators of compromise associated with this IP address |

## Automation
This section provides information on how the capability can be automated.

| Automation ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C3101-AUT-1 | Automated scripts or tools to block IP addresses based on predefined criteria or alerts from threat intelligence sources. | Script |
| C3101-AUT-2 | Integration with threat intelligence platforms to automatically update firewall rules with newly identified malicious IP addresses. | Integration |
| C3101-AUT-3 | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to manage and deploy firewall configurations that include blocked IP addresses. | Infrastructure |
