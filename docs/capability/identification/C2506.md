## Overview
This capability enables incident responders to identify Windows services that have been modified during a specified timeframe. Service modifications can indicate malware attempting to hijack legitimate services, configuration changes for persistence, or attackers modifying service properties to evade detection.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
