## Overview
This capability involves identifying and listing the data that has been transferred within a network. It is essential for monitoring data flow, ensuring compliance with data handling policies, and detecting unauthorized data transfers. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, log analysis, or other methods to track data transfers within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst

## Fields
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| File Path | Full path of the transferred file |
| File Name | Name of the transferred file |
| File Size | Size of the transferred file in bytes |
| Transfer Timestamp | Date and time when the data transfer occurred |
| Source Location | Source location or system where data originated |
| Destination Location | Destination location or system where data was transferred |
| Transfer Method | Method used for data transfer (FTP, HTTP, SMB, email, etc.) |
| User Context | User account associated with the data transfer |
| Process Name | Process that initiated the data transfer |
| File Hash | Hash value of the transferred file (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) |
