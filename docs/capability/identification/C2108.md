&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C2108-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Identification_%28P0002%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves identifying and listing hosts that are connected to a VPN (Virtual Private Network). It is essential for monitoring network security, ensuring compliance with access policies, and detecting unauthorized access. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, VPN logs analysis, or other methods to track VPN connections within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst

## Fields
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Host IP Address | IP address of the host connected to VPN |
| VPN Connection Timestamp | Date and time when VPN connection was established |
| VPN User Identity | Username or identity associated with the VPN connection |
| VPN Server Endpoint | VPN server or gateway that the host connected to |
| Connection Duration | Duration of the VPN connection session |
| VPN Protocol | VPN protocol used (IPSec, SSL/TLS, WireGuard, etc.) |
| Bytes Transferred | Amount of data transferred during the VPN session |
| Geolocation Data | Geographic location information for the connection |
