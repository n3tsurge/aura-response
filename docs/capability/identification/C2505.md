## Overview
This capability allows incident responders to identify newly created Windows services during a specified timeframe. Service creation is a common persistence mechanism used by malware and attackers to maintain access to compromised systems. Monitoring service creation helps detect unauthorized persistence mechanisms and malicious service installations.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
