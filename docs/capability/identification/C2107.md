&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C2107-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Identification_%28P0002%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves identifying and listing hosts that are communicating over a specific port. It is essential for understanding network traffic patterns, detecting potential security threats, and ensuring that only authorized hosts are interacting with critical services. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, logs analysis, or other methods to track communication flows within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst

## Fields
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Port Number | The specific port number being monitored for communication |
| Protocol Type | Network protocol associated with the port (TCP, UDP) |
| Source Host IP | IP address of the host initiating communication |
| Destination Host IP | IP address of the host receiving communication |
| Communication Timestamp | Date and time when the communication occurred |
| Service Name | Name of the service running on the specified port |
| Connection State | State of the connection (established, listening, closed, etc.) |
| Data Volume | Amount of data transferred during the communication |
| Host Names | DNS names or hostnames of the communicating hosts |
| User Context | User account or process associated with the communication |
