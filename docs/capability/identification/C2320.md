## Overview
This capability enables security analysts to analyze file naming patterns and characteristics to identify suspicious files, social engineering attempts, or files designed to evade detection. Filename analysis can reveal attempts to mimic legitimate files, use deceptive extensions, or employ naming conventions associated with malware campaigns.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
