## Overview
This capability allows incident responders to identify registry keys that have been deleted from Windows systems. Deleted registry keys can indicate evasion techniques, cleanup activities by malware, or attempts to hide persistence mechanisms. This analysis is crucial for understanding the full scope of system modifications during an incident.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
