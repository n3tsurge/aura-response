## Overview
This capability allows incident responders to identify Windows services that have been deleted or uninstalled during a specified timeframe. Service deletion can indicate cleanup activities by malware, evasion techniques, or attempts to remove evidence of persistence mechanisms after an attack.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
