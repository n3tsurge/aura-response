&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C2109-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Identification_%28P0002%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves identifying and listing hosts that are connected to an intranet. It is essential for monitoring network security, ensuring compliance with access policies, and detecting unauthorized access. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, logs analysis, or other methods to track intranet connections within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst
