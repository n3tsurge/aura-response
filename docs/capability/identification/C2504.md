## Overview
This capability allows incident responders to identify newly created registry keys on Windows systems. New registry key creation is often associated with malware persistence, system configuration changes, or software installation activities. Monitoring registry key creation helps detect unauthorized changes and potential persistence mechanisms.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
