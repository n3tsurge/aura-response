## Overview
This capability focuses on identifying data that has been transferred based on its content. It is essential for understanding the nature of data movement within a network, especially in cases of potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access. By analyzing the content of transferred data, security teams can detect anomalies and respond to potential threats effectively.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst
