&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C2105-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Identification_%28P0002%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves identifying and listing hosts that are communicating with a specific internal URL. It is essential for understanding network traffic patterns, detecting potential security threats, and ensuring that only authorized hosts are interacting with critical internal resources. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, logs analysis, or other methods to track communication flows within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst

## Enrichment
- **Reverse IP Lookup**: Use a reverse IP lookup service to find all domains associated with a specific IP address. This can help identify other potential targets or related entities.

## Fields
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Source IP Address | Source IP address of the communication |
| Destination IP Address | Destination IP address of the communication |
| Communication Timestamp | Date and time when the IP communication occurred |
| Protocol Type | IP protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) |
| Packet Size | Size of the IP packet in bytes |
| TTL Value | Time-to-Live (TTL) value of the IP packet |
| Flags | IP packet flags (fragmentation, etc.) |
| Geolocation Source | Geographic location of the source IP |
| Geolocation Destination | Geographic location of the destination IP |
| ASN Source | Autonomous System Number for source IP |
| ASN Destination | Autonomous System Number for destination IP |
