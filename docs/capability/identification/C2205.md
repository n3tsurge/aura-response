## Overview
This capability involves extracting indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IP addresses, file hashes, domains, and other artifacts from email messages for threat intelligence and further analysis. This is critical for identifying malicious infrastructure and enabling proactive defense measures.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
