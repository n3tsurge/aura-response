## Overview
This capability allows incident responders to enumerate and list all user accounts within the environment, including local accounts, domain accounts, service accounts, and disabled accounts. This enumeration is essential for understanding the scope of potential compromise and identifying unauthorized or suspicious accounts.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.
