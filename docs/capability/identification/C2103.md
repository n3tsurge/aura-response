## Overview
This capability involves identifying and listing hosts that are communicating with a specific internal URL. It is essential for understanding network traffic patterns, detecting potential security threats, and ensuring that only authorized hosts are interacting with critical internal resources. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, logs analysis, or other methods to track communication flows within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst
