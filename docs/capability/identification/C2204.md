## Overview
This capability enables security analysts to confirm whether an email message is phishing through various analysis techniques including content analysis, sender verification, link analysis, and comparison with known phishing indicators. This verification is crucial for accurate incident classification and response prioritization.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
