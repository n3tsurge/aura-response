## Overview
This capability enables deep analysis of specific registry key content, values, metadata, and structure to identify malicious modifications, persistence mechanisms, or configuration changes. This analysis provides detailed insights into the purpose and impact of registry modifications discovered during incident response.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
