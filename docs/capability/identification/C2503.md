## Overview
This capability enables incident responders to monitor and list registry keys that have been accessed during a specified timeframe. Registry access patterns can reveal reconnaissance activities, configuration enumeration, or attempts to gather system information by malware or unauthorized users.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
