## Overview
This capability enables incident responders to identify and list users who have successfully authenticated to systems during a specified timeframe. This information is crucial for understanding user activity patterns, identifying potentially compromised accounts, and establishing timelines during incident investigations.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
