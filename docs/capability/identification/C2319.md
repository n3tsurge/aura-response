## Overview
This capability enables security analysts to analyze Java Archive (JAR) files to identify malicious content, suspicious code patterns, embedded payloads, or unauthorized functionality. JAR file analysis is crucial for detecting Java-based malware, understanding attack vectors, and identifying security risks in Java applications.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
