&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID-C2106-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-Identification_%28P0002%29-blue)&nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network-blue)
## Overview
This capability involves analyzing URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) communication to identify potential security threats, unauthorized access, or malicious activities. It includes examining the structure of URIs, the protocols used, and the data transmitted to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns. This analysis is crucial for understanding how resources are accessed and ensuring that only legitimate traffic is allowed within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst

| Domain/Host | Domain name or host specified in the URI |
| Port Number | Port number specified in the URI |
| Path Component | Path component of the URI |
| Query Parameters | Query string parameters included in the URI |
| Fragment Identifier | Fragment identifier (anchor) in the URI |
| Access Timestamp | Date and time when the URI was accessed |
| User Agent | User agent string associated with the URI request |
| Source IP Address | IP address that accessed the URI |
| HTTP Status Code | HTTP response status code for the URI request |
