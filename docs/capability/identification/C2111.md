## Overview
This capability involves collecting and analyzing data that has been transferred within a network. It is essential for monitoring data flow, ensuring compliance with data handling policies, and detecting unauthorized data transfers. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, log analysis, or other methods to track and analyze data transfers within the network.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- incident-responder
- security-analyst
