## Overview
This capability involves defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of incident response operations. KPIs help in assessing the performance of the incident response team, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that the incident response process aligns with organizational goals. This capability is essential for continuous improvement and accountability in incident response operations.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder
