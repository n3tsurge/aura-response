It is crucial for understanding network behavior and detecting potential security incidents. |
| [Access Internal Packet Capture Data](../capability/access-internal-packet-capture/index.md) | C1109 | Preparation | This capability outlines the process for accessing internal packet capture data, which is crucial for analyzing network traffic and identifying potential security incidents.  Internal packet data highlights traffic flowing from internal assets to internal destinations. It serves as a guide for incident response teams to effectively gather and utilize internal packet capture data during the preparation phase of incident response. |
| [Access External Packet Capture Data](../capability/access-external-packet-capture/index.md) | C1109 | Preparation | This capability outlines the process for accessing external packet capture data, which is crucial for analyzing network traffic and identifying potential security incidents.  External packet data highlights traffic flowing from internal assets to external destinations and vice versa. It serves as a guide for incident response teams to effectively gather and utilize external packet capture data during the preparation phase of incident response. |

## Identification Phase

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [List Alert Victims](../capability/list-alert-victims/index.md) | C2001 | Identification | This capability allows for stakeholders to list all victims affected by the incident. It provides a comprehensive overview of those impacted, enabling better resource allocation and response planning. |
| [List Host Vulnerabilities](../capability/list-host-vulnerabilities/index.md) | C2002 | Identification | This capability involves the ability to identify and list vulnerabilities present on hosts within a network. It includes scanning for known vulnerabilities, assessing their severity, and compiling a report of findings to inform remediation efforts. |
| [List Registry Key Modifications](../capability/list-registry-key-modification/index.md) | C2501 | Identification | This capability allows the incident responder and security analyst to list modifications made to registry keys. This is crucial for identifying unauthorized changes that may indicate malicious activity or system misconfiguration. The capability provides a means to track changes over time, aiding in forensic analysis and incident response. |

## Recovery Phase

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Reinstall Host from Golden Image](../capability/reinstall-host-from-golden-image/index.md) | C5001 | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of reinstalling a host from a golden image. It includes steps for preparation, execution, and verification to ensure that the host is restored to a known good state using a pre-configured image. |
| [Restore Data from Backup](../capability/restore-data-from-backup/index.md) | C5002 | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of restoring data from backups. It includes steps for verifying backup integrity, selecting the appropriate backup set, and executing the restoration process to ensure that data is recovered accurately and efficiently. |
| [Unblock Blocked IP](../capability/unblock-blocked-ip/index.md) | C5101 | Recovery | This capability outlines the process of unblocking an IP address that has been previously blocked due to security concerns.
