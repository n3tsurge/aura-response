## Lessons-learned Phase

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Develop Incident Report](lessons-learned/C6001.md) | C6001 | Lessons-learned | This capability involves creating a detailed incident report that summarizes the incident, actions taken, and lessons learned. The report serves as a reference for future incidents and helps improve the incident response process. It should include timelines, impact assessments, and recommendations for future prevention. |
| [Conduct Lessons Learned Exercise](lessons-learned/C6002.md) | C6002 | Lessons-learned | This capability involves organizing and conducting a lessons learned exercise to review the incident response process. The exercise aims to gather feedback from all stakeholders, identify what worked well, what didn't, and how future responses can be improved. It should include discussions, documentation of findings, and actionable recommendations for future incidents. |

## Operations Phase

| Capability | ID | Phase | Description |
|------------|----|-------|-------------|
| [Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](operations/C7001.md) | C7001 | Operations | This capability involves defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of incident response operations. KPIs help in assessing the performance of the incident response team, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that the incident response process aligns with organizational goals. This capability is essential for continuous improvement and accountability in incident response operations. |
| [Maintain a Risk Register](operations/C7002.md) | C7002 | Operations | This capability involves maintaining a risk register that documents identified risks, their potential impact, and the mitigation strategies in place. The risk register is a crucial tool for managing security risks within an organization, allowing teams to prioritize and address vulnerabilities effectively. It serves as a living document that is regularly updated to reflect the current risk landscape. |
| [Maintain Leadership Reporting and Awareness](operations/C7004.md) | C7004 | Operations | This capability involves maintaining regular reporting and awareness for leadership regarding the status of security operations and incident response activities. This includes providing updates on ongoing incidents, metrics on response times, and overall security posture. Effective leadership reporting is crucial for ensuring that decision-makers are informed about the security landscape and can allocate resources appropriately. |
| [Maintain a Team Knowledge Base](operations/C7003.md) | C7003 | Operations | This capability involves maintaining a knowledge base for the security operations and incident response teams. A team knowledge base is essential for documenting lessons learned, best practices, and procedures that can be referenced during security operations and response activities. This capability helps ensure that the team has access to critical information that can improve response times and effectiveness during incidents. |
