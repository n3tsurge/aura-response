# Capabilities

| Capability | ID | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| [Access Vulnerability Management System Logs](../capability/C1013.md) | C1013 | This is a template for capabilities that can be used to define specific actions or processes within a phase. It serves as a starting point for creating detailed capability specifications. |
| [Access External Flow Logs](../capability/C1101.md) | C1101 | This capability involves accessing external flow logs to gather information about network traffic and communications. It is essential for understanding the context of incidents and identifying potential threats or anomalies in the network. |
| [Access Internal Flow Logs](../capability/C1102.md) | C1102 | This capability involves accessing internal flow logs to gather information about network traffic and communications. It is essential for understanding the context of incidents and identifying potential threats or anomalies in the network. |
| [Access Internal HTTP Logs](../capability/C1103.md) | C1103 | This capability involves accessing and reviewing internal HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access External HTTP Logs](../capability/C1104.md) | C1104 | This capability involves accessing and reviewing external HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications. |
| [Access Internal DNS Logs](../capability/C1105.md) | C1105 | This capability allows security teams to access internal DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. |
| [Access External DNS Logs](../capability/C1106.md) | C1106 | This capability allows security teams to access external DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. External DNS logs differ from internal DNS logs as they capture communication from internal systems to external domains, providing insights into outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration attempts. |
| [Access VPN Logs](../capability/C1107.md) | C1107 | This capability involves accessing and reviewing VPN logs to identify any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts. It is crucial for understanding remote access behavior and detecting potential security incidents. |
| [Access DHCP Logs](../capability/C1108.md) | C1108 | This capability involves accessing and reviewing DHCP logs to identify any anomalies or unauthorized activities related to IP address assignments. It is crucial for understanding network behavior and detecting potential security incidents. |
| [List Alert Victims](../capability/C2001.md) | C2001 | This capability allows for stakeholders to list all victims affected by the incident. It provides a comprehensive overview of those impacted, enabling better resource allocation and response planning. |
| [List Host Vulnerabilities](../capability/C2002.md) | C2002 | This capability involves the ability to identify and list vulnerabilities present on hosts within a network. It includes scanning for known vulnerabilities, assessing their severity, and compiling a report of findings to inform remediation efforts. |
| [List Registry Key Modifications](../capability/C2501.md) | C2501 | This capability allows the incident responder and security analyst to list modifications made to registry keys. This is crucial for identifying unauthorized changes that may indicate malicious activity or system misconfiguration. The capability provides a means to track changes over time, aiding in forensic analysis and incident response. |
| [Template](../capability/C0000.md) | C0000 | This is a template for capabilities that can be used to define specific actions or processes within a phase. It serves as a starting point for creating detailed capability specifications. |
