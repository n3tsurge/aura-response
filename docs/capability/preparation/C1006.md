## Overview
This capability involves establishing a centralized and long-term log storage solution to ensure that all relevant logs are collected, stored, and retained for future analysis and compliance purposes. This includes implementing a logging infrastructure that can handle large volumes of data, ensuring the integrity and security of the logs, and providing mechanisms for easy retrieval and analysis of logs when needed.

## Requirements
For a tool or system to implement this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

| Requirement ID | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
