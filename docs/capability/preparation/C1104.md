## Overview
This capability involves accessing and reviewing external HTTP logs to gather information about web traffic, identify potential threats, and analyze user behavior. It is essential for understanding the context of web-based incidents and for proactive monitoring of web applications.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- commander
- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.

- security-analyst
- incident-responder

## Enrichment
For a tool or system to implement this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

- **Geolocation**: Enrich the IP address with geolocation data to understand the origin of the request.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious IP addresses or user agents.
- **User Context**: Correlate the request with user profiles to understand user behavior and potential insider threats.

## Hunting
For a tool or system to implement this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

- **Anomalous Behavior Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in HTTP requests, such as spikes in traffic from a specific IP address or unusual request methods.
- **Phishing Detection**: Analyze URLs for signs of phishing attempts, such as suspicious domains or query parameters.
- **Data Exfiltration Monitoring**: Monitor for large data transfers or unusual access patterns that may indicate data exfiltration attempts.
- **Malware Distribution**: Identify requests that may be serving malware or malicious content based on known indicators of compromise (IOCs).

## Fields
For a tool or system to implement this capability, the following requirements should be considered:

- **HTTP Request Method**: The method used in the HTTP request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **URL**: The full URL of the request, including query parameters.
- **Response Status Code**: The HTTP status code returned by the server (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- **User Agent**: Information about the client software making the request.
- **Device Name**: The Device Name from which the web activity originated.
- **Source User**: The user that initiated the web traffic.
- **IP Address**: The IP address of the client making the request.
- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the request was made.

## Tools
The following tools provide this capability:

- [Cisco Firewall (ASA/NGFW)](../tool/cisco-fw/C1104.md)
- [Palo Alto Firewall](../tool/palo-alto-fw/C1104.md)
- [SentinelOne](../tool/sentinelone/C1104.md)
- [Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA)](../tool/zscaler-zia/C1104.md)
