## Overview
This capability involves establishing the ability to find processes by their file path. This includes implementing mechanisms to track and catalog processes based on their executable paths, ensuring that all process activity can be monitored and analyzed. It is essential for system monitoring, incident response, and security assessments, providing visibility into the operational state of systems and potential malicious activities by allowing quick identification of processes based on their location in the file system.
