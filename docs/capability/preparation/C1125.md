## Overview
This capability involves establishing the ability to identify data that has been transferred across networks or systems. This includes implementing mechanisms to recognize and classify transferred data, ensuring that all data can be accurately identified and monitored. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, compliance with regulations, and enhancing overall security posture by providing visibility into data movement within the organization.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the capability.

- incident-commander
- security-analyst
- scribe

## Staff
Staff are individuals or systems that interact with and execute a capability.
