## Overview
This capability outlines the process for accessing internal packet capture data, which is crucial for analyzing network traffic and identifying potential security incidents.  Internal packet data highlights traffic flowing from internal assets to internal destinations. It serves as a guide for incident response teams to effectively gather and utilize internal packet capture data during the preparation phase of incident response.
