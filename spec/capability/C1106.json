    "description": "This capability allows security teams to access external DNS logs, which are crucial for monitoring and analyzing domain name system activities within the network. By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. External DNS logs differ from internal DNS logs as they capture communication from internal systems to external domains, providing insights into outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration attempts.",
