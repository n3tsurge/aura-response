    "description": "This capability involves quarantining email messages that are suspected to be malicious or spam. Quarantining is a containment measure that prevents potentially harmful emails from reaching the inbox of users, thereby reducing the risk of phishing attacks, malware distribution, and other email-based threats. This can be implemented through email security solutions that automatically detect and isolate suspicious messages for further analysis or review.",
