    "description": "This capability involves removing specific permissions from a user account to limit their access to systems and data. This action is typically taken in response to suspicious activity or when a user account is compromised. Removing permissions helps to contain the incident and prevent potential damage while further investigation is conducted. It is an essential step in the incident response process to protect sensitive information and maintain security.",
