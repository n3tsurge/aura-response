    "description": "This capability involves quarantining files based on their hash values to prevent the execution of known malicious files. Quarantining files by hash is a containment measure that helps mitigate risks associated with file-based threats, such as malware or ransomware. This can be implemented through security solutions that automatically detect and isolate files with specific hash values deemed suspicious or unsafe, allowing for further analysis or safe handling.",
