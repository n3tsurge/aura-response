    "description": "This capability focuses on identifying data that has been transferred based on its content. It is essential for understanding the nature of data movement within a network, especially in cases of potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access. By analyzing the content of transferred data, security teams can detect anomalies and respond to potential threats effectively.",
