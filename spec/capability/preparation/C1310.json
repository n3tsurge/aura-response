    "description": "This capability involves establishing the ability to find a file by its content pattern within a system or network. This includes implementing mechanisms to analyze and identify specific content patterns within files, ensuring that all files can be efficiently accessed and managed based on their content. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, facilitating quick access to necessary files, and enhancing overall operational efficiency by providing visibility into file contents within the organization.",
