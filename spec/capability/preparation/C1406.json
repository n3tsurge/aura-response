    "description": "This capability involves establishing the ability to find processes by their content patterns. This includes implementing mechanisms to analyze and identify specific content patterns within the processes running on a system. It is essential for system monitoring, incident response, and security assessments, providing visibility into the types of processes that may exhibit suspicious or malicious behavior based on their content.",
