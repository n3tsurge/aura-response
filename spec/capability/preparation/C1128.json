This is crucial for understanding the security posture of the network, ensuring that the firewall is configured correctly, and identifying any potential gaps or misconfigurations in the firewall rules. The capability includes implementing mechanisms to retrieve and display the current firewall rules, ensuring that they are up-to-date and aligned with organizational security policies.",
