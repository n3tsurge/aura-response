    "description": "This capability involves establishing the ability to block processes by their content patterns. This includes implementing mechanisms to prevent specific processes from executing based on the content they contain, such as specific code patterns or signatures. It is essential for enhancing security by preventing unauthorized or malicious processes from running, thereby protecting the system from potential threats.",
