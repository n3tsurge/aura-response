    "description": "This capability involves establishing the ability to find processes by their format. This includes implementing mechanisms to identify and categorize processes based on their format, such as executable files, scripts, or other types of process formats. It is essential for system monitoring, incident response, and security assessments, providing visibility into the types of processes running on a system and enabling the identification of potentially malicious or unauthorized processes based on their format.",
