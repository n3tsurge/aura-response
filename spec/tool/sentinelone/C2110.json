    "description": "This tool capability allows stakeholders to identify and list data transfer activities using SentinelOne's file monitoring and network visibility features. It helps track file movements, uploads, downloads, and potential data exfiltration.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### How to List Data Transferred via SentinelOne Console (GUI)\n\n1. **Log into the SentinelOne Management Console.**\n2. Navigate to the **'Visibility'** tab and select **'Deep Visibility'**.\n3. Configure filters for data transfer analysis:\n   - Set event types to **'File'**, **'Network'**, and **'Process'**\n   - Apply time range for investigation period\n   - Filter by file operations: **'Copy'**, **'Move'**, **'Upload'**, **'Download'**\n4. Use advanced queries to track data transfers:\n   ```\n   event.type = 'File Modification' and (file.operation = 'Copy' or file.operation = 'Move')\n   event.type = 'Process Creation' and process.name contains 'ftp' and process.cmdline contains 'put'\n   event.type = 'IP Connect' and dst.port in (21, 22, 80, 443) and event.network.bytesSent > 1000000\n   ```\n5. Analyze transfer events to identify:\n   - `File Path` - source and destination paths\n   - `File Size` - size of transferred files\n   - `Transfer Method` - mechanism used (FTP, HTTP, SMB, email)\n   - `User Context` - user performing the transfer\n   - `Process Name` - application used for transfer\n   - `Network Destination` - external transfer targets\n   - `Transfer Timestamp` - when transfer occurred\n6. Use **'File Integrity Monitoring'** to track file movements.\n7. Correlate with **'Network Events'** to identify upload/download activities.\n8. Apply **'DLP Integration'** if available for sensitive data detection.\n9. Export transfer logs for compliance and forensic analysis.\n\n### Using SentinelOne API\n\n```bash\n# Query file transfer events\ncurl -X GET \"https://[console].sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/dv/events\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: ApiToken [your-token]\" \\\n  -G -d \"eventTypes=file,process,ip\" \\\n  -d \"queryFilter=file.operation in ('Copy', 'Move')\" \\\n  -d \"limit=1000\"\n```\n\n### Advanced Query Examples\n\n```sql\n-- Large file transfers\nEventType = \"File\" AND FileSize > 100000000 AND FileOperation = \"Copy\"\n\n-- Network uploads\nEventType = \"IP\" AND DstPort In (\"80\", \"443\") AND BytesSent > 10000000\n\n-- USB/Removable media transfers\nEventType = \"File\" AND FilePath Contains \"E:\\\" AND FileOperation = \"Copy\"\n```\n\nThis provides comprehensive visibility into data movement activities for DLP and security analysis.",
