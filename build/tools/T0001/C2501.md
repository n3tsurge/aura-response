# SentinelOne - List Registry Key Modifications

## Overview

This tool capability enables security analysts and incident responders to identify registry key modifications using SentinelOne. Registry changes are common indicators of persistence, privilege escalation, or configuration tampering. # Workflow

## Searching within SentinelOne EDR/XDR

The below query will identify all registry key modifictions per host and source process. When it is necessary, filtering the logs for a specific host is possible by adding `| filter endpoint.name == "HOSTNAMEHERE"` before the `group` clause.

```php

event.type in ('Registry Value Modified')

| group count=count() by endpoint.name,registry.keyPath,src.process.image.path

```
