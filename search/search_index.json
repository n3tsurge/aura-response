By examining these logs, teams can identify potential security threats, track user activities, and understand the context of events that may indicate a security breach. External DNS logs differ from internal DNS logs as they capture communication from internal systems to external domains, providing insights into outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration attempts. Block External IP Address C3101 Containment This capability involves blocking external IP addresses that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic from these IP addresses is denied. Block Port External Communication C3107 Containment This capability involves blocking external communication on specific ports that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through firewall rules, intrusion prevention systems, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic on these ports is denied. Block External Domain C3103 Containment This capability involves blocking external domains that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through DNS filtering, firewall rules, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic to these domains is denied. Block External URL C3105 Containment This capability involves blocking external URLs that are identified as malicious or suspicious. It is a proactive measure to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential threats from external sources. This capability can be implemented through web filtering, firewall rules, or other network security tools to ensure that traffic to these URLs is denied. List Hosts Communicating with External Domain C2113 Identification This capability involves identifying and listing hosts that are communicating with a specific external domain. It is essential for understanding network traffic patterns, detecting potential security threats, and ensuring that only authorized hosts are interacting with external resources. This capability can be implemented through network monitoring tools, logs analysis, or other methods to track communication flows within the network.
